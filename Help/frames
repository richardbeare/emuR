Unless one of `justdata', `justindex' or `justftime' are specified, the
result is an object of class `trackdata' and has the following components: 
.RC data
A matrix of data corresponding to the specified parameter track for the
segment list.  The number of dimensions (columns) in the matrix depends
on the track specified, for example, track `"fm[1..3]"' (formants 1 to 3)
will have three columns. The data for all segments is concatenated in
rows, the data corresponding to a particular segment can be extracted
using the `index' component. 
.RC index
A matrix with two columns giving the start and end indexes of each segment
within the `data' matrix.
.RC ftime
A matrix with two columns giving the start and end times of each
segment copied from the segment list.  Both the `index' and the `ftime'
components will have the same number of rows as the original segment
list.
