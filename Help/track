.FN track
.TL
Extract track data for a segment list
.CS
track(segs, param, cut=NULL, index=T)
.RA
.AG segs
A mu+ segment list. 
.AG param
One of the available parameter names (use `tracks()' to find which
parameters are available for the current database).
.OA
.AG cut
If this argument, a number between 0 and 1, is specified, each segment
is sampled at the corresponding point. For example, cut=0.5 will return
one sample per segment taken from the segment mid-point. 
.AG index
If TRUE, an index to the returned data vector is constructed consisting
of start and end positions for each segment within the data vector and
the starting and ending times of each segment.
.RT
If `index' is `FALSE', a matrix of data is returned consisting of the
concatenation of the parameter tracks for each segment.  The matrix may
have more than one column if the requested parameter is
multi-dimensional (for example the first three formants `"fm[1..3]"').  If
the `cut' argument was used, each row of the matrix will correspond to
one segment.  If `index' is TRUE the return value has the following three
components:
.RC data
The concatenated matrix of data.
.RC index
A matrix with two columns giving the start and end indexes of each segment
within the `data' matrix.
.RC ftime
A matrix with two columns giving the start and end times of each
segment copied from the segment list.  Both the `index' and the `ftime'
components will have the same number of rows as the original segment
list.

# First we find out which tracks are available for the current Utterances:

> tracks()
[1] "samples"    "F0"         "prob_voice" "rms"        "ac_peak"   
[6] "k1"         "fm[1..4]"   "bw[1..4]"  

# Now we extract the "samples" track (the raw sample speech data) for our
# segment list: 

my.samp <- track(my.segs, "samples")

# Next we extract the first three formants at the mid point of each
# segment:

my.form <- track(my.segs, "fm[1..3]", cut=0.5)
