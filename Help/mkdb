.AG directory
The directory which contains the label files which will form the
database. Note that you should not include a trailing `/' on the path
name. 
.AG extn
The file extension for label files.
.AG pattern
A pattern to match the desired utterances (use the same format as you
would on the unix command line, i.e. `?' matches any one character, `*'
matches any number of characters).
.RT
A mu+ utterance vector. 
.DT
This function is used to generate an utterance vector from a given
directory. The utterance vector specifies the database to be searched
by `phon' and other functions.  Each element of the vector is the
name of a label file with the file extension removed.  This then refers
to a family of files containing the information about the utterance
(label file, sample data file etc.).

# Create an utterance list containing all utterances in directory `"dbase"':

# restrict the utterance list to those files begining with msa:
