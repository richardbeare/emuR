A vector of sampled data values, which is output from `track'.
.AG rate
The sampling rate at which playback takes place.

.AG internalspeaker
If TRUE play uses the internal speaker,

.AG pauselen
Specifies the duration of the pauses in seconds.

The sampling rate at which you select for playback, could have an
effect on the naturality of the output. For natural sound, the playback
sampling rate will need to be the same as the recording sampling
rate. A higher playback rate will increase the speed of the output. A
lower rate will decrease it.
