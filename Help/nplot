.BG
.FN nplot
.TL
Plot normal data curve
.CS
nplot(values, labs, xlab="", ylab="probability density", 
      main="", colour=T, linetype=F, plot.lab=T, 
      xlim, logprob=F)
.RA
.AG values
A vector of numeric values. 
.AG labs
A vector of label, parallel to `values'. 
.OA
.AG xlab
An y-axis label
.AG ylab
A y-axis label
.AG main
A main title for the plot. 
.AG colour
If colour is TRUE, the curves and labels will be plotted in different
colours. 
.AG linetype
If linetype is TRUE, the curves will be plotted with different
linetypes.  This is useful for plots that will be printed. 
.AG plot.lab
If plot.lab is TRUE, labels will be plotted above each normal curve.
.AG xlim
A vector of the minimum and maximum values to plot on the x-axis. 
.AG logprob
If TRUE, the log-normal curve will be plotted. 
.SE
Generates a plot on the current device which shows the distribution of
the data in `values' for each unique label in `labs'. 
.DT
The data is split according to the unique labels in `labs' and the mean
and variance of each data set is calculated. The probability density
for each data set is then plotted.  
.SA
hplot, dnorm
.KW mu
.KW plot
