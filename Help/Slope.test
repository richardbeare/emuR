this function takes any number of two column matrices.
The first column is the y-data (in the case of locus equations, this
is the vowel onset) and the second column is the x-data (in the case of
locus equations, vowel target). 
.RT
The return value consists of the following componenets:
.RC separate
slope, intercept, r-squared, F-ratio, "d(egrees of) f(reedom)"
and "prob(ability that) line fits data" for the separate data matrices entered.
.RC combined
F-ratio, "d(egrees of) f(reedom)", and "Probability of 
them being DIFFERENT" for the slope and for the intercept of the combined
data. 
.RC x 
the combined x-data for all the matrices. 
.RC y 
the combined y-data for all the matrices. 
.RC mat
the category vectors for the combined data 
(consists of 1, 0 and -1). 
.RC numrows
the number of rows in each matrix. 
.RC numcats
the sum number of matrices entered.
