.RA
.AG data
A vector or matrix of data
.AG model
A Gaussian model generated by `train'. 
.RT
A label vector with one element per row of `data'
.DT
The `model' argument contains the mean and inverse covariance matrix
(or standard deviation if the data is one-dimensional) for each class
in the training set as well as the class labels.  This function
calculates the Mahalanobis distance of each row of `data' from each
class mean and assigns the label of the closest mean to that row.  The
result is a vector of labels corresponding to the rows of `data'.

The Mahalanobis distance between a data point and a class is the
Euclidean distance between the point and the class mean devided by the
covariance matrix for the class.  This means that classes with large
covariances will

attract
data points from a larger area than those with small covariances.
