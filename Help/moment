.FN moment
.TL
Calculate the spectral moment.
.CS
moment(specvals, least=T, nyq=10000, low=0, high=nyq)
.RA
.AG specvals
A data matrix representing spectral values, as returned by `muspec'.
.OA
.AG least
If TRUE, normalise each spectrum so that its minimum is 0dB.
.AG nyq
The maximum frequency of the spectrum (the nyquist frequency: half the
sampling frequency).
.AG low
Set the low end of the spectral range to consider (Hz).
.AG high
Set the high end of the spectral range to consider (Hz). 
.RT
A list with two components:
.RC first
The first spectral moment (spectral centre of gravity) for each row of
the input matrix.
.RC second
The second spectral moment (spectral variance or moment of inertia) for
each row of the input matrix.
