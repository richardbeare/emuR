.FN dplot
.TL
Plot MU+ trackdata.
.CS
dplot(dataset, labs=NULL, offset=0, ref.time=NULL, average=F, 
	main="", xlab="time (ms)", ylab="", xlim=NULL, ylim=NULL, 
	cex=0.5, linetype=F, normalise=F, colour=T, legn="tl", 
	axes=T)
.RA
.AG dataset
A MU+ trackdata object.
.OA
.AG labs
A label vector parallel to `dataset'. 
.AG offset
A number between 0 and 1, segments are alligned on the plot with this
proportion of their duration corresponing to zero. 
.AG ref.time
A vector of one time per segment, an alternative to `offset', segments
will be lined up on the plot with these times at zero. 
.AG average
If T, the data for each unique label in `labs' is averaged. 
.AG normalise
If T, the data for each segment will be time normalised so that all
segments appear to have the same length on the plot. 
.AG main
A main title for the plot.
.AG xlab
A label for the x-axis.
.AG ylab
A label for the y-axis.
.AG xlim
A vector of the minimum and maximum limits of the x-axis.
.AG ylim
A vector of the minimum and maximum limits of the y-axis.
.AG cex
The `cex' parameter passed to `par' to control text size on the plot. 
.AG linetype
.AG colour
colour and linetype can be either T, F or a vector.  If they are F then
the plot will use a single colour or linetype.  If they are T then the
plot will use a different colour/linetype for each line.  If they is a
vector then it should consist of one label for each element to be
plotted, the colour/linetype will be selected according to this label.
.AG legn
The position to draw the legend, one of `"tl"' (top-left), `"tr"'
(top-right), `"bl"' (bottom-left) or `"br"' (bottom-right).
.AG axes
If T, axes will be drawn on the plot.
.RT
None
.SE
A plot of the track data is generated on the current graphics device. 
.DT
This function is a general purpose plotting function for track data
generated by the `track' function.  Data for each segment is lined up
at some point along its length (eg. at the start, midpoint or end) and
possibly normalised or averaged before being plotted.  Normalisation
consists of stretching each segment out to have the same number of
samples as the longest segment; the stretching is done with the MU+
function `linear'.  Averaging takes account of the different lengths of
the segments in computing the average for each time point.
