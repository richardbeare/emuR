Arithmetic calculation on spectral data

fcalc(fftdata, byrow=T, samfreq=20000, nyq=samfreq/2, 
      low=0, high=nyq, fun=sum, ...)
.RA
.AG fftdata
FFT spectral values as returned from `muspec' with `dbspec=T' (the default) or `muslice'.
.AG byrow
If TRUE (default), the arithmetic calculation will be done on each row.
If FALSE, they will be done on each column.
.AG samfreq
Sampling frequency of the data (Default assumes 20 kHz).
.AG nyq
The upper limit of the spectrum (the Nyquist frequency or half the
sampling frequency).
.AG low
Starting frequency in Hz over which the function in `fun' is to be applied.
.AG high
Ending frequency in Hz over which the function is to be applied.
.AG fun
Any Splus arithmetic function to be applied on `fftdata'. (Default function is
`sum').
.OA
.AG ...
Extra arguments, which must be unique to `fcalc', that are needed for
the `fun' function.
.RT
`fcalc' returns the results of the calulation in `$vals'.
.DT
The spectral values (in dB's) are first converted back into energy
values, the function `fun' is then applied to the data and the result
is converted back into dB's.
.SA
muslice, muspec
.EX
Calculate the variance of each spectrum in the 1-4 kHz range
