.RA
.AG segs
A mu+ segment list.
.AG param
One of the valid track parameters for the current segment list (see
`tracks'). 
.OA
.AG data
If this is provided it should be a matrix of data corresponding to
`param' for the segment list `segs'.  This data is plotted rather than
the data extracted from the database. 
.AG labtype
The type of labels to use in the utterance plot. For example if
`labtype = "Syllable"' then the syllable boundaries will be drawn on
the graph and labelled accordingly. 
.AG colour
If `TRUE' then different colours will be used for different parts of
the plot. If `FALSE' the plot will use only one colour (useful for prining).
.AG linetype
If `TRUE' then different line types will be used for the plot (useful
for printing). 
.AG xlim
The range of the x-axis (time).
.AG ylim
The range of the y-axis. 
.AG xlab
A label for the x-axis.
.AG ylab
A label for  the y-axis.
.AG main
A main title for the plot. 
.AG zeros
If TRUE, then the parts of the utterance where the probability of
voicing is less than `pdat' will not be plotted. This is only reliable
for the parameter track "F0".
.AG pdat
The threshold for probability of voicing used with `zeros'.
.AG boundplot
If TRUE, label boundaries will be drawn (for either the original
segments or the labels specified by `labtype').
.AG labels
A vector of labels to be plotted instead of those corresponding to the
segment list or the labels specified by `labtype'. You must also
specify `labeltimes'. 
.AG labeltimes
A vector of times at which to plot the labels in `labels'. 
.AG labcentre
If TRUE, the labels in `labels' are drawn between the time values in
`labeltimes', rather than at these times. In this case `labels' must
contain one less element than `labeltimes'.
.AG differ
An integer greater than 1. If `differ' is 1 the first difference (first
derivitive, or gradient) is plotted and so on. 
.AG smoothing
If TRUE, the data is smoothed before being plotted. 
.AG flipped
If TRUE, the data is inverted. 
.AG axes
If FALSE no axes are drawn on the plot. 
.AG talk
If TRUE the sample data for the utterance will be retrieved and can be
played back interactively from the plot.  
.AG label
If TRUE, labels can be added to the plot interactively. 
.AG ispk
If TRUE, the internal speaker will be used for playback of speech (in
combination with the `talk' argument. If FALSE, the external speaker or
headphones will be used. 
.PP
This function will also accept any of the standard graphical parameters
which can be passed to `par()', for example `cex' which specifies the
size of characters to be used.  
.SE
A plot of the requested parameter track is generated.  Segment
boundaries are drawn and labelled according to the options specified.
If `talk' is TRUE, parts of the utterance can be played back using the
left mouse button to define the boundaries of the section to be played.
The middle mouse button quits this interaction.
