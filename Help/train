Train a Gaussian Model
.CS
train(x, lab)
.RA
.AG x
A data vector or matrix.
.AG lab
A vector of labels parallel to `x'. 
.RT
A structure with the following components: 
.RC label
The unique labels in `lab'.
.RC means
The means for each dimension per unique label. 
.RC cov
The combined covariance matrixes for each unique label. The
matrixes are joined with `rbind'.  If the input data is
one-dimensional, this is just the standard deviation of the data. 
.RC invcov
The combined inverse covariance matrixes for each unique label. The
matrixes are joined with `rbind'.  If the input data is
one-dimensional, this is just the reciprocal of the standard deviation
of the data.
.DT
This function is used to train a gaussian model on a data set. The
result can be passed to either the `mahal' or `bayes.lab' functions to
classify either the training set (`x') or a test set with the same
number of dimensions.  Train simply finds the mean and inverse
covariance matrix/standard deviation for the data corresponding to each
unique label in labs.
