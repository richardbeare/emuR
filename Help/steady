.BG
.FN steady
.TL
Find the steady-state portion of a parameter
.CS
steady(values, percent=25, mean=T, smoothing=F)
.RA
.AG values
  A set of parameter tracks as returned by track().  The values would
normally correspond to formant data.
.OA
.AG percent
The size of the portion to search for. If percent is 25 (the default)
the returned values correspond to a portion of each segment of that
size (relative to the segment duration) which is the most steady state. 
.AG mean
If mean is TRUE, the mean for each parameter (formant) accross the
steady state portion will be returned for each segment. 
.AG smoothing
If smoothing is TRUE the data will be smoothed before the steady-state
portion is searched for. 
.RT
The return value is a copy of the original `values' argument with the
additional components: 
.RC  steady
specifies the start and end indexes of the steady-state portion of each
segment,
.RC time
specifies the position of the midpoint of the steady state portion as a
proportion of the duration of each segment.
.RC mean 
If the mean argument is `TRUE' this component specifies the means of
each parameter accross the steady state portion of each segment.

.DT
The algorithm searches for the portion of the signal with the smallest
summed inter-euclidean distance (the euclidean distances between
successive points) for all segments of the parameter track of the
required size.  Thus, if the signal consists of three formants, the three
dimensional euclidean distance is calculated between successive
samples. The distances are then summed over samples 1..n, 2..n+1 etc
where n is the required width.  The smallest such sum is taken as the
most steady-state portion of the signal.
