# emuR
====

maintenance for the emu R package from sourceforge.

This repo is converted from the emu-splus folder in the emu cvs repository on 
sourceforge. 

emu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/emu

The emuR package isn't maintained, and an alternative is apparently being prepared. We need to keep it working
on new versions of R, and this is the repo that will contain the necessary updates.

## Installation
